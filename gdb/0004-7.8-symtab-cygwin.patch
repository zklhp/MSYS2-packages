+  /* On Windows, some functions use the `stdcall' calling convention,

+     confusion, the linker symbols for `stdcall' functions have names

+     `foo' expects N argument bytes, N != M, then the call will be a
+     reference to `foo@M', but the definition will have a linker
+     symbol `foo@N', and you'll get a link-time `symbol not found'
+     error, instead of a crash at run-time.
